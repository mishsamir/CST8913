## Migration Plan for Tailwind OpenCare

### Discovery and Tooling Setup.
- Tools for Discovery:
  - Azure Migrate (for discovery, assessment, and migration tracking).
  - Azure Migrate Appliance (deployed on-prem for agentless discovery).
  - Azure Dependency Visualization (to analyze network dependencies).
  - Azure Security Center (to assess security risks pre-migration.
- Data to be Collected:
   - OS versions and patch levels.
   - Installed software inventory.
   - Application dependencies and traffic flow.
   - Performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network usage.
   - Compliance and security settings
- Credential & Permission Management:
   - Use Azure Key Vault for storing migration credentials securely.
   - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure to ensure least privilege access.
   - Use Just-In-Time (JIT) access to limit exposure of critical credentials.
### Assessment Planning.
- Assessment Parameters:
   - Performance history: 30-day historical data for CPU, memory, disk usage.
   - Sizing strategy: Performance-based sizing (scale dynamically as needed).
   - Networking: Validate VNET and subnet planning for security compliance.
   - Resiliency: Assess availability zone usage for high availability
- Target Azure Infrastructure:
   - Region: Azure East US (for low latency & compliance support).
   - Compute: Azure Virtual Machines (D-series for balanced performance).
   - Storage: Premium SSD for database and caching, Standard SSD for application servers.
   - Databases: Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis
- Validation Approach:
  - Conduct review sessions with stakeholders to verify assessment accuracy.
  - Perform cost estimation analysis based on Azure Pricing Calculator.
  - Test workload simulation in a sandbox environment
